# Branch Ideation
### An app to mimic our brain's natural "branching" thought process.
###### Every thought can have unlimited branches added to it - an LLM responds. It is meant to reflect something similar to the Socratic method of reasoning, where every question and answer creates additional questions and answers. A user can then download their thought process into a usable format.
